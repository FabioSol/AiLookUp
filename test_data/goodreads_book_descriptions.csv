Good Harbor,"Anita Diamant's international bestseller ""The Red Tent"" brilliantly re-created the ancient world of womanhood. Diamant brings her remarkable storytelling skills to ""Good Harbor"" -- offering insight to the precarious balance of marriage and career, motherhood and friendship in the world of modern women. The seaside town of Gloucester, Massachusetts is a place where the smell of the ocean lingers in the air and the rocky coast glistens in the Atlantic sunshine. When longtime Gloucester-resident Kathleen Levine is diagnosed with breast cancer, her life is thrown into turmoil. Frightened and burdened by secrets, she meets Joyce Tabachnik -- a freelance writer with literary aspirations -- and a once-in-a-lifetime friendship is born. Joyce has just bought a small house in Gloucester, where she hopes to write as well as vacation with her family. Like Kathleen, Joyce is at a fragile place in her life.
A mutual love for books, humor, and the beauty of the natural world brings the two women together. They share their personal histories, and help each other to confront scars left by old emotional wounds.
With her own trademark wisdom and humor, Diamant considers the nature, strength, and necessity of adult female friendship. ""Good Harbor"" examines the tragedy of loss, the insidious nature of family secrets, as well as the redemptive power of friendship."

The Gingrich Senators: The Roots of Partisan Warfare in Congress,"The Senate of the mid twentieth century, which was venerated by journalists, historians, and senators alike, is today but a distant memory. Electioneering on the Senate floor, playing games with the legislative process, and questioning your fellow senators' motives have become commonplace.
In this book, noted political scientist Sean Theriault documents the Senate's demise over the last 30 years by showing how one group of senators has been at the forefront of this transformation. He calls this group the ""Gingrich Senators"" and defines them as Republican senators who previously served in the House after 1978, the year of Newt Gingrich's first election to the House. He shows how the Gingrich Senators are more conservative, more likely to engage in tactics that obstruct the legislative process, and more likely to oppose Democratic presidents than even their fellow other Republicans. Phil Gramm, Rick Santorum, Jim DeMint, and Tom Coburn are just four examples of the group that has includes 40 total senators and 22 currently serving senators.
Theriault first documents the ideological distinctiveness of the Gingrich Senators and examines possible explanations for it. He then shows how the Gingrich Senators behave as partisan warriors, which has radically transformed the way the Senate operates as an institution, by using cutthroat tactics, obstructionism, and legislative games.

Grace for Drowning,"From the New York Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal best-selling author of The Alpha Group comes a new romance about the devastating power of guilt and two people's struggle to overcome their pasts. 
Hope is a dangerous thing. I know that more than most. Everything good I've ever had has been stolen from me -- my friends, my fiance, my innocence, some would say even my sanity. All I have left is the cage. Fighting is the only thing that eases the ache inside me even a little. It's the only thing that keeps the bottle at bay.
I was content to ride out my life alone. I was done dreaming that things could be better. But then I met Grace, and from that moment, all I could do was dream.
She's battling those same demons, only she's losing. I don't want to care, but something about her calls to me. That pain in her eyes is so sharp, so familiar. I know it's only a matter of time before it pulls her below the surface.
I can help her, and maybe, just maybe, she can help me too. For the first time in what feels like forever, I've got hope, and that scares the hell out of me.
This book is told from dual perspectives, so both Grace and Logan get their say. It is a full length (300 page) novel with no cliffhanger. There is likely to be a sequel, but the story can be enjoyed alone.
Not suitable for younger readers. This is an intense story that deals with issues of alcoholism and military PTSD, and it contains adult content."

Sleeping Beauty, the royal family, and its retainers are not happy about being woken from their sleep by an absurd, unpretentious, Walser-like hero. Mary and Joseph are taken aback by what lies in store for their baby Jesus."

I'm with Stupid,"A hilarious tale of girl meets boy, girl falls in lust, girl discovers boy is not playing with a full deck...
When Kas meets William while on safari in South Africa he seems perfect-a gorgeous park ranger, both kind and brave (he saved the tour from certain death by water buffalo). Her two best friends, Max, an endlessly scheming personal trainer, and Libby, a jobless bombshell, would like to get their hands on William...but he's only interested in Kas, an editorial assistant at a struggling New York literary agency who thinks William is out of her league. The two have a fling, and Kas returns home to New York wondering if she'll hear from William again. So when he finally sends an email, she's delighted.
Until she opens it. 
The email is not quite the love missive Kas expected. Did she misjudge William? A miscommunication ensues, triggering a rapid-fire series of comic developments that, within days, bring William to New York, now under the impression that Kas has offered him a place to live. As he unveils his big plan to take Manhattan by storm and make his fortune, Kas finally recognizes how limited William's intellectual capabilities are: He makes Kevin Federline look like Albert Einstein.
Readers are along for the outrageous ride as Kas copes with her new roommate's eccentricities, including a preoccupation with the Psychic Friends Network and a passion for collecting Big Apple-themed souvenirs, and the realization that her dream man is a comic nightmare.

My Life in Middlemarch,"A New Yorkerwriter revisits the seminal book of her youth--Middlemarch--and fashions a singular, involving story of how a passionate attachment to a great work of literature can shape our lives and help us to read our own histories.
Rebecca Mead was a young woman in an English coastal town when she first read George Eliot's Middlemarch, regarded by many as the greatest English novel. After gaining admission to Oxford, and moving to the United States to become a journalist, through several love affairs, then marriage and family, Mead read and reread Middlemarch. The novel, which Virginia Woolf famously described as ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up people,"" offered Mead something that modern life and literature did not.
In this wise and revealing work of biography, reporting, and memoir, Rebecca Mead leads us into the life that the book made for her, as well as the many lives the novel has led since it was written. Employing a structure that deftly mirrors that of the novel, My Life in Middlemarchtakes the themes of Eliot's masterpiece--the complexity of love, the meaning of marriage, the foundations of morality, and the drama of aspiration and failure--and brings them into our world. Offering both a fascinating reading of Eliot's biography and an exploration of the way aspects of Mead's life uncannily echo that of Eliot herself, My Life in Middlemarchis for every ardent lover of literature who cares about why we read books, and how they read us.

The Cost of Doing Business,"""Poetic, down trodden and nihilistic, Jonathan Ashley treads through parts of the human psyche that others fear for one black tar mind-fuck-ride of a novel.""
- Frank Bill, author of CRIMES IN SOUTHERN INDIANA and DONNYBROOK
In Jonathan Ashley's dark humor debut crime novel, a Louisville bookstore owner leaves his used volumes of Yeats behind to get into the drug trade and make some real money.
Jon Catlett, a misanthropic literary obsessive, is facing the loss of the only thing in the world he loves; his used bookstore, a haven for fellow weirdos, outcasts, misunderstood geniuses and malcontents. Jon has several other problems, the least of which are his love affair with a bi-polar femme fatale heiress to a thriving northern steel company or the exponentially growing opiate habit he has developed.
When Jon, during a deal gone wrong, accidentally kills a fellow drug addict, getting away with murder turns out to be the least of his worries. The steps he and Paul, the obsessive-compulsive manager of Jon's store, must take to cover up the killing result in the two cornering Louisville's blossoming heroin trade.
From West End gangbangers to dirty cops and crusading narcotics detectives, Jon and his unstable partner in crime must dilute their morals and thicken their skin if they are to have any hope of surviving the lucrative but deadly life they've stumbled upon.
MORE PRAISE FOR THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS:
""Ashley breaks our hearts, he breaks all the rules and, most importantly, he breaks our expectations of what a simple crime story can be. He shatters it, in fact, leaving readers craving another deadly taste--much like the lost souls in this chilling, amazing story.""
- Patrick Wensink, author of BROKEN PIANO FOR PRESIDENT
""We live in a capitalistic society, yes, but nobody said doing business is easy or even enjoyable. Jonathan Ashley makes this point quite well in The Cost of Doing Business. Of course when the business is the heroin trade, the stakes are life and death, but is the suspicion, the betrayal, the plotting and scheming, all that different than what goes on in the corporate world? Louisville bookstore owner Jon Catlett leaves his used volumes of Yeats behind to get into the drug trade and make some real money, and the result is blood-filled mayhem. He never loses his sense of literate irony, though, taking us through a fast, unpredictable novel with equal parts darkness and humor. A very confident debut.""

On the Move: A Life,"When Oliver Sacks was twelve years old, a perceptive schoolmaster wrote in his report: ""Sacks will go far, if he does not go too far.""

As he recounts his experiences as a young neurologist in the early 1960s, first in California, where he struggled with drug addiction, and then in New York, where he discovered a long-forgotten illness in the back wards of a chronic hospital, we see how his engagement with patients comes to define his life.
With unbridled honesty and humor, Sacks shows us that the same energy that drives his physical passions--weight lifting and swimming--also drives his cerebral passions. He writes about his love affairs, both romantic and intellectual; his guilt over leaving his family to come to America; his bond with his schizophrenic brother; and the writers and scientists--Thom Gunn, A. R. Luria, W. H. Auden, Gerald M. Edelman, Francis Crick--who influenced him.
On the Moveis the story of a brilliantly unconventional physician and writer--and of the man who has illuminated the many ways that the brain makes us human."

"The Afterlife (Joe Vampire, #2)","So...yeah. It's me again. America's most sarcastic vampire.
I'm back on the blog. It's been a while - about a year, if we need to get into specifics. Which I usually do. It's just a thing with me.
A lot has happened since we last chatted - some good, some bad. All worthwhile, in the grand scheme. I've dealt with the whole Living Dead thing long enough now to know how to keep it from taking over my life. What I'm still figuring out is how to keep it from wreaking havoc on everyone else's lives. It's a roller coaster, for sure, but I'm convinced that waiting for me somewhere on the other side of the Other Side is a real-life life, not just some artificially-sweetened half-life substitute. I want a family. I want my music.
I want the dream come true, not the dream fell through.
And I'm determined to have it, regardless of how eternal this afterlife thing might be. But it's a hell of a lot to keep track of. Barring any unforeseen developments that might undo all my vampirosity, I may have to grow up a little in order to get it all to work out. I'm ready for that, though.
As fun as it might seem to hang with the Lost Boys, I can't be Peter Pan-pire forever."

That changes the day she meets Leigh. Disillusioned with small-town life and looking for something greater, Leigh is not a ""nice girl."" She is unlike anyone Vanni has met, and a friend when Vanni desperately needs one. Soon enough, Leigh is much more than a friend.

Birth of a Vampire
Will and Wonder
Rue lives in the quiet little town of Calvary, Minnesota with her brother Kai, and her parents, Grace and William. Calvary is a beautiful place, with no crime, no drama and nestled along the great lakes. It is surrounded in lush forests, quiet, safe, everything you could ever wish for...or is it?
As Rue approaches her 17th birthday she is plagued with one problem, a very big one. Her Mother, Grace, has fallen ill. It is not a disease that can easily be fixed with medication, it is one of the mind. Grace has been admitted to Rolling River Asylum and once she is gone, Rue's perfect world starts to crumble around her. Everything she has known is suddenly taken from her and with it her feeling of safety is dissolved.
Desperate to pull Rue out of her depression, her brother talks her into going to a party at the Graph house, home to Johnathan Graph, a boy Rue has always felt a strong connection to, but never acted on it. Once she is at the party she reconnects with Johnathan and is shocked at how her feelings seem to be so strong for him, but with one touch Rue has a terrifying vision and it sets everything into motion.
Soon after her revelation at the party, Grace and William suddenly disappear and with their absence two strangers, that of Joshua and Samantha Barrington, enter into Rue's life. They come as protectors, not only to her, but to everyone she loves. Without them she would be lost, but with them she is reminded of how much she does not know. There is a war coming, a war that threatens everything she loves, everything she knows or ever will know. She is forced to face the truth about herself and about her family's history, a truth that stems back to the beginning of time and that of the vampire.
